The history of identity management in computing is like a rollercoaster ride that’s been going on since the dawn of computers. It all started with simple single-user systems that didn’t need any fancy identity management. Then, things got more complex with centralized mainframes that could handle multiple users. Next came the rise of single-user desktops and multi-user Unix systems, each with its own unique identity management system. And finally, we have the distributed cloud services that use identity management to keep everything secure and organized. In this chapter, we’ll take a look at how identity management has evolved over time to meet the changing security needs and technological capabilities of computers. We’ll also highlight the important role of cryptography primitives in these systems.

## Identity in Early Day Multi-User Computing
Back in the 1950s, computers were like super-heavy machines that only a few fancy government agencies or big institutions could afford. To make them work faster, they came up with this thing called batching processing. Basically, they’d give the computers a bunch of tasks at once and run them in a line. And guess what? There wasn’t really a concept of a ‘user’ back then. All tasks were treated the same, no matter who did them.
  
In the 1960s, time-sharing systems were born. The idea was that multiple users could run tasks at the same time on a shared computer. The computer would divide up time slots for each task. The user who used their allocated time slots would be temporarily removed from the system to let other tasks run. So, time-sharing systems were naturally multi-user systems. Multics, short for Multiplexed Information and Computing Service, was probably the first multi-user computer system with special modules for managing user identities. Multics was a collaborative project that MIT, Bell Labs, and General Electric worked on in the 1960s. Multics was a big project aimed at creating a super-smart multi-user operating system that would let users share access, keep things secure, and have advanced features. Even though it faced a lot of challenges, its impact on the development of future multi-user systems, like Unix, is huge.

In Multics, users had to enter a unique username and a password to log in. These were stored safely in the system. This combination of username and password was like a secret code that only the right people could use to access the system and its stuff. Multics was a big step forward in computer security, and it showed how to keep multi-user systems safe. But how exactly did they keep the passwords safe? It’s hard to find the details. It’s probably that they were encrypted or hashed in some way, but it might as well be stored in plaintext. Passwords were a new idea in the 1960s, so Multics’s way of using them was a big deal in making sure that only the right people could access the system.


## Identity in The Mainframe Era (1960s-1970s)

Back in the early days of computing, things were pretty simple when it came to identity management. Mainframe systems were all centralized, so it was easy to keep track of who was who and what they could do. IBM’s Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS) operating system introduced one of the first really comprehensive security systems, called the Resource Access Control Facility (RACF), back in 1976. RACF had some pretty cool ideas that are still relevant today:

- It used usernames and passwords to identify people and make sure they could only access things they were supposed to.
- It had lists of who could access what resources, like files and folders.
- It separated people’s roles and gave them different levels of access.
- It kept track of everything that happened with security, so people could see who did what and why.

The mainframe era set the foundation for identity management that we still use today. We have things like user identification, authentication, authorization, and accountability.

Back in the early days of IBM mainframes, password management was a bit simpler than it is now. Passwords were often stored in plain text, right in the system’s operating system. This was because computers were super slow and didn’t have much storage space back then. So, anyone who had access to the system could see the passwords. But hey, they also had to physically access the mainframe, which was usually kept in a secure place. This helped keep people out and made it harder for someone to steal the passwords.

Since computers didn’t have super strong encryption back then, security mostly relied on keeping the mainframe safe and trusting the people who had access to it. They used access control lists (ACLs) to decide who could do what. These early systems didn’t have the fancy security stuff we have now, like hashing and salting, which protect passwords by making them harder to guess. And they didn’t have centralized password management systems, so each application or system had its own set of user accounts and passwords.
As technology advanced, IBM mainframes got smarter about keeping passwords safe. They started using encryption, which turned passwords into secret codes before storing them. And guess what? They also made security software even better, with stronger encryption and more ways to control who can access the system. Back in the day, mainframe password management was mostly about keeping things physical and using simple security measures. But now, thanks to all this tech, these systems are super secure and can’t be easily hacked.

## Identity in Unix and Distributed Systems (1970s-1980s)

Unix brought significant innovations to identity management, introducing concepts that remain fundamental to modern systems:

- The separation of user and group identities
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC) through file permissions
- The `/etc/passwd` file for user management
- The concept of a superuser (root) with unlimited privileges

As networks grew and Unix systems became interconnected, new challenges emerged. Network Information Service (NIS, originally called Yellow Pages) was developed by Sun Microsystems to provide centralized authentication across Unix networks, though it had significant security limitations.

## Enterprise Identity Management (1980s-1990s)

The growth of enterprise networks drove the development of more sophisticated identity management solutions:

### Kerberos (1980s)
Developed at MIT as part of Project Athena, Kerberos introduced:
- Ticket-based authentication

As technology continues to evolve, identity management will remain crucial for securing digital resources and protecting user privacy.

The journey from mainframes to modern cloud systems shows how identity management has become increasingly sophisticated while striving to balance security with usability. Future developments will likely continue this trend, incorporating new technologies while maintaining the core principles established in the earliest days of computer security.


## The Early Days: Clear Text Passwords

In the early days of computing, passwords were stored in clear text. This meant that anyone with access to the storage system could easily read the passwords. This was extremely vulnerable to security breaches.

Hackers could readily steal passwords from databases or exploit system vulnerabilities. To address this glaring weakness, one-way hashing was introduced in the 1970s.

## One-Way Hashing: A Step Towards Security

One-way hashing involves running the password through a function that produces a unique hash (a fixed-length string of characters) that cannot be reversed to retrieve the original password. While hackers could steal the hash, they couldn't easily access the passwords.

This was a significant advancement in security, but it still had limitations. Hackers could use dictionary attacks or brute-force methods to guess passwords by comparing hashes with known word lists or by trying every possible combination. This led to the development of more robust cryptographic techniques.

## Public Key Cryptography: A Paradigm Shift

The 1980s ushered in public key cryptography, a revolutionary innovation that transformed the landscape of security. Public key cryptography uses a pair of keys: a public key that can be shared with anyone and a private key that must be kept secret. Information encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key. This system enables secure communication and authentication without the need to share the private key. Public key cryptography is now widely used in identity management for various purposes, including secure logins, digital signatures, and encryption of sensitive data. It significantly enhances the security of online transactions and interactions.
## Digital Certificates: Verifying Identities

The 1990s witnessed the development of digital certificates, electronic documents that verify the identity of an individual or organization. They leverage public key cryptography to ensure authenticity and security.

## Digital certificates are commonplace for secure website connections (HTTPS), email encryption, and software signing. They provide a trusted way to verify the identity of websites and software applications, mitigating the risk of phishing attacks and malware.
## Multi-Factor Authentication: Adding Layers of Security

The 2000s saw the rise of multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA requires users to provide multiple forms of authentication, such as a password, a physical token, and a biometric scan. This creates an extra layer of security, making it significantly harder for unauthorized users to gain access to accounts.

MFA has become a best practice for securing online accounts, especially for sensitive accounts like online banking, email, and social media.
## Cloud-Based Identity Management: Centralized Control

The 2010s witnessed the emergence of cloud-based identity management solutions. These solutions offer a centralized platform for managing identities, access permissions, and authentication processes.

This simplifies identity management for organizations, allowing them to scale their operations more effectively and improve security while reducing costs. Cloud-based solutions also provide a more flexible and agile approach to identity management, enabling organizations to quickly adapt to changing security requirements and user needs.
## Passkeys and Biometrics: A Passwordless Future

The 2020s have seen the rise of passkeys and biometrics, representing the next generation of identity management solutions. Passkeys are a new type of credential designed to be more secure and user-friendly than traditional passwords. They leverage cryptography and biometrics to verify a user's identity. Passkeys are stored in the user's device's operating system, making them resistant to phishing attacks. They can be used for various purposes, including logging into websites, apps, and even physical devices. Biometrics refers to the use of unique biological characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, and iris scans, for authentication. Biometric authentication is becoming increasingly popular, offering a convenient and secure way for users to verify their identity. It enhances security by using highly personal and unique identifiers.
Conclusion: A Journey of Security and Convenience

The evolution of identity management has been driven by a relentless pursuit of enhanced security while simultaneously seeking greater user convenience. The transition from clear text passwords to passkeys, driven by advancements in cryptography, has significantly improved the security of online accounts and interactions. As we move towards a passwordless future, the adoption of passkeys and biometrics will continue to shape the way we authenticate and access digital resources. This evolution is ensuring a safer and more convenient digital experience for all.
