For the past two decades, I’ve been lucky to build several identity and cryptography services. This book is like a treasure trove of my knowledge and experience, and I am thrilled to share it with the community!

My security journey started in 2000 when I was working on embedded telecommunication devices. My boss asked me to enable SSL for the signaling server on that device. I had no idea what SSL was, but being young and trusting, I couldn’t say no to my boss. So, I took on the challenge. I ported the OpenSSL library to the proprietary embedded operating system, wrote a proxy service, similar to a simplified Nginx in C code, to ground the SSL connection from outside and relay the request and response to the signaling server running behind. Oh, and what X.509 certificate did I use? Great question! We created a program so each device would generate a self-signed certificate using RSA because we thought we only needed confidentiality of the communication, not so much about authentication of the SSL communication, at the time. That was a time when internet information was scarce, so I had to really dig into how RSA worked. From then on, somehow I became the go-to person for security-related stuff. I’ve been working on security-related services ever since.
