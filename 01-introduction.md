My security professional journey started in 2000 when I was working on embedded telecommunication devices. My boss asked me to enable SSL for the signaling server on that device. I had no idea what SSL was, but being young and trusting, I couldn’t say no to my boss. So, I took on the challenge. I ported the OpenSSL library to the proprietary embedded operating system, wrote a proxy service, similar to a simplified Nginx in C code, to ground the SSL connection from outside and relay the request and response to the signaling server running behind. Oh, and what X.509 certificate did I use? Great question! We created a program so each device would generate a self-signed certificate using RSA because we thought we only needed confidentiality of the communication, not so much about authentication of the SSL communication, at the time. Building a complete Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) was clearly out of my wit in my early twentieth. That was a time when internet information was scarce, so I had to really dig into how RSA, SSL and encryption worked. The OpenSSL source code helped a lot when I was struggling to compile the sourcr code for our proprietary operating system. From then on, somehow I became the go-to person for security-related stuff. I’ve been working on security-related services ever since. The merits of the story are: **Open source software is good for security. A robust open source security library, such as OpenSSL, promote best practices and its transparency ensures its trustworthiness.**

I moved on to another exciting security project. The telecom company I worked for wanted to create a universal device management platform, and I was chosen to lead a small team of junior engineers in developing the security aspects of the platform. One of the divisions of the company introduced us to a powerful security framework from Sun Microsystems. It had an impressive XACML (Extensible Access Control Makrup Language) engine. This gave me the chance to dive into the world of policy-based access control, learning about concepts like Policy Decision Point (PDP), Policy Enforcing Point (PEP), and the XML-based policy language. It was mind-blowing! At the time, creating new markup languages was the hottest thing of the industry. It seemed like this omnipotent access control language could do anything we wanted, even things we didn’t even realize we wanted. We integrated the XACML framework into our product and thought we had solved all our security problems… but we didn’t. The framework was quite complex and took a lot of time to set up properly. The device management platform was designed for a small group of enterprise administrators who usually shared all the responsibilities of the work. They didn’t need overly complex access control policies. We offered a very complex and powerful security solution that they didn’t need. Looking back, a few predefined roles with hard-coded permissions would have been just fine for them. But the telecom industry was changing, and the company I worked for eventually went bankrupt. The platform was soon deprecated. The takeaway from this story is: **Security solutions should be simple. Complex security means no security.**

I stumbled upon a job at a company that specializes in Single Sign On (SSO). I was immediately drawn to SSO technologies because they offer a secure solution that simplifies people’s lives. Unlike other security measures that often add complexity, SSO streamlines the process. The company placed its trust in supporting SAML in enterprise SSO solutions, and I was working on developing Cloud-based SSO solutions. The company was fully committed to OpenID Connect (OIDC) even though it was still at its inception. This turned out to be a wise decision, as OIDC has since become the de facto standard for Cloud-based SSO and identity federation. However, we also attempted to develop a LDAP-based directory product for the Cloud market. Unfortunately, this project didn’t materialize. Customers who require a directory service would opt for Microsoft Active Directory and its Cloud counterpart, leaving little room for another Cloud directory in the market. So the gist of the story is: **Security standards are crucial. Choose the right one wisely.**

Since I was working on Cloud-based identity, Amazon Identity, which is the team behind the sign-in page on Amazon.com, offered me a job, and I couldn’t resist the temptation to learn how a massive internet-scale identity management system works. One of the coolest things I did during this time was this concept called composable validation. It was like a tiny, dedicated micro-frontend that enforced security. For instance, we revamped the password reset process of Amazon retails. Instead of sending a link to the user’s device, we used a one-time passcode widget to verify that the user owns the email or mobile phone associated with their Amazon account. This was a huge improvement, especially since many customers in certain countries still used feature phones with limited web browsing capabilities. But that’s not all - we also designed the OTP widget and the backend logic behind it to be composable. They can be easily added to any other workflows. We composed several similar security validation widgets into Amazon’s risk-driven authentication system. Based on factors like the customer’s context, time, location, and the item they’re ordering, the machine learning engine would recommend the appropriate level of security validation for the transaction, by composing the widgets dynamically. It was a huge success! The takeaway: **Designing and implementing security controls is tough. We want to make them composable so they can be reused like Lego blocks to build more complex workflows.**

Identity solutions are essentially cryptography systems, using encryption, decryption, signing, and verification to manage identities. For instance, in the OIDC, the JWT (JSON Web Token) needs to be signed, encrypted, or both. Identity solutions can’t function without cryptography. I moved on to work in AWS Key Management Service, which offers cryptography key lifecycle management and cryptography primitives as a service. If there’s one word to describe my contribution to KMS, it’s scalability. I joined the service when its traffic started doubling every year. KMS struggled to meet the growing demand from customers. We had to throttle almost everyone. I helped scale the transactional data store, which was the biggest bottleneck. Then, I built the data lake, analytical database, and workflows on top of them to scale the operations since we couldn’t just add more people to support the ever-growing system. Finally, I moved to the backend of KMS to scale its hardware security module, the special hardware device that does the actual cryptography operations on the keys. The lesson I learned: **a security solution needs to scale - for customer demand, operational excellence, and raising security standards. A security service that limits customers’ consumption will only force them to find workarounds, which often lead to less secure solutions.**
