# The Ideal Data Store for Identity Data: A Modern Approach

In today's digital landscape, identity data has evolved far beyond simple username and password combinations. As organizations grow increasingly interconnected and cloud-native, the requirements for managing identity data have fundamentally changed. In this essay I will explore the concept of an ideal data store for identity data, examining both traditional approaches and emerging paradigms that address modern needs.

## The Expanding Scope of Identity Data

Identity data encompasses a vast ecosystem of related information:

- **User identities**: Personal profiles, preferences, credentials, and authentication factors
- **Group structures**: Team memberships, organizational units, and access control groups
- **Relationship graphs**: Social connections, reporting hierarchies, and organizational structures 
- **Machine identities**: Devices, services, APIs, and autonomous agents
- **Cryptographic material**: Keys, certificates, tokens, and signatures
- **Policy frameworks**: Rules, constraints, and governance models
- **Resource associations**: Entitlements, permissions, and access grants

Traditionally, organizations have relied on relational databases or directory services like Microsoft Active Directory to store this information. While these systems provided adequate solutions for on-premises environments with relatively stable identity populations, they face significant limitations in modern cloud-native, distributed architectures.

## Limitations of Traditional Identity Stores

Traditional identity stores were designed for different requirements:

1. **Static hierarchy assumptions**: Directory services like LDAP assume relatively static hierarchical structures that poorly accommodate dynamic, graph-based relationships.

2. **Limited scalability**: Many traditional systems struggle with internet-scale identity populations and high transaction volumes.

3. **Monolithic architecture**: Legacy identity stores often function as isolated silos, creating integration challenges.

4. **Insufficient auditability**: While basic logging exists, these systems rarely treat identity changes as first-class events.

5. **Poor support for machine identities**: Traditional directories were primarily designed for human users, not the explosion of non-human identities.

## Event-Sourced Identity: A New Paradigm

A modern identity data store should embrace event sourcing as a foundational principle. In this approach, every change to identity data is captured as an immutable event, creating a comprehensive historical record. This paradigm shift offers several critical advantages:

### 1. Complete Identity Lifecycle Tracking

An event-sourced identity store maintains a complete history of all identity changes. Each modification—whether creating a new user, changing group membership, rotating a cryptographic key, or updating a policy—generates an immutable event. This creates an authoritative timeline that preserves:

- Who initiated the change (human operator or automated system)
- When the change occurred (precise timestamp)
- What specifically changed (detailed before/after states)
- Why the change was made (business justification or automation trigger)
- How the change was authorized (approval workflow or policy validation)

This comprehensive record enables precise reconstruction of the identity state at any point in time—critical for security investigations, compliance audits, and operational troubleshooting.

### 2. Decoupled Command and Query Responsibilities

The event-sourced approach naturally aligns with the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern, which separates write operations from read operations. This separation enables:

- **Optimized transactional store**: A database optimized for current-state operations and high-throughput identity verification
- **Specialized analytical store**: A separate data warehouse or lake for historical analysis, pattern detection, and complex queries
- **Purpose-built projections**: Custom data views optimized for specific identity-related services

This architecture allows organizations to scale authentication services independently from analytics systems, preventing analytical workloads from impacting authentication performance.

### 3. Enhanced Security and Compliance

Event sourcing dramatically improves security posture by:

- **Tamper evidence**: Since the event log is append-only and cryptographically verifiable, unauthorized modifications become immediately apparent
- **Non-repudiation**: Every identity change maintains cryptographic proof of the actor who initiated it
- **Fine-grained accountability**: Detailed attribution extends to every attribute modification
- **Compliance documentation**: The event stream provides ready-made evidence for regulatory requirements
- **Forensic investigation**: Security teams can precisely reconstruct the sequence of events during incidents

### 4. Workflow Integration and Orchestration

Identity changes frequently trigger complex workflows involving multiple systems:

- Provisioning accounts across diverse applications
- Applying time-bound permissions during emergency access
- Orchestrating approval chains for privilege escalations
- Managing identity lifecycle during employee transitions

An event-sourced identity store provides natural integration points for saga-pattern workflows, where each identity event can trigger appropriate downstream processes while maintaining transactional integrity.

## Identity Access Logs: Fueling Real-Time and Historical Analysis

Beyond tracking identity mutations as events, a comprehensive identity data store must also capture all access and authentication events. These access logs form a critical dataset that complements the identity state information:

### 1. Access Event Capture

Every interaction with the identity system generates valuable signals:
- Authentication attempts (successful and failed)
- Authorization decisions (grants and denials)
- Resource access patterns (what, when, and how)
- Session activities (creation, validation, termination)
- Credential usage (which factors were employed)

These events must be captured with high fidelity, including contextual information such as:
- Geographic location and network origin
- Device characteristics and trust status
- Time patterns and session duration
- Access method and protocol details
- Request characteristics and payload sizes

### 2. Real-Time Stream Processing

Access logs should feed directly into streaming analytics platforms for immediate processing:
- Detecting authentication anomalies in real-time
- Identifying potential credential theft or account takeovers
- Enforcing velocity-based access controls
- Triggering step-up authentication when risk is detected
- Providing visibility into active identity usage

This real-time capability enables security operations to identify and respond to threats within seconds rather than hours or days. Stream processing engines can apply complex event processing rules that detect sophisticated attack patterns involving multiple identity components.

### 3. Long-Term Analysis in the Data Lake

Beyond immediate security operations, access logs provide immense value when incorporated into a comprehensive data lake:
- Building baseline behavior models for each identity
- Conducting threat hunting across historical access patterns
- Performing compliance reporting and attestation
- Optimizing identity infrastructure based on usage patterns
- Supporting capacity planning and performance tuning

The data lake approach allows organizations to maintain years of access history in a cost-effective manner, using tiered storage strategies that balance accessibility with economy. This historical repository becomes invaluable during forensic investigations, enabling security teams to establish complete attack timelines and identify the full scope of security incidents.

### 4. Machine Learning Applications

The rich dataset provided by access logs enables sophisticated AI/ML applications:
- Anomaly detection models that adapt to evolving user behavior
- User entity behavior analytics (UEBA) for insider threat detection
- Risk scoring algorithms to drive adaptive authentication
- Predictive models for privilege abuse detection
- Clustering techniques to identify role and access pattern similarities

These machine learning models improve over time as they ingest more data, continuously refining their understanding of normal versus anomalous identity behavior.

### 5. Integration with Identity Governance

Access logs provide essential feedback for identity governance processes:
- Supporting evidence-based certification decisions
- Highlighting unused or excessive privileges
- Identifying shadow IT through unexpected access patterns
- Validating the effectiveness of access controls
- Measuring the impact of governance policy changes

By closing the loop between access activity and governance, organizations can implement truly data-driven identity management practices.
