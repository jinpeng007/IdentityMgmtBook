## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of hardware-based security and identity solutions implemented by the three major cloud service providers (CSPs): Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We analyze their respective approaches to hardware root of trust, secure key management, confidential computing, and hardware-backed identity management. Our findings highlight the different architectural choices made by each provider, their relative strengths and limitations, and the security guarantees they offer. This survey provides valuable insights for organizations seeking to understand the hardware security foundations underpinning their cloud infrastructure and can guide decision-making when selecting cloud platforms based on security requirements.

**Keywords:** hardware security, cloud computing, root of trust, confidential computing, identity management

## 1. Introduction

As organizations migrate increasingly sensitive workloads to public cloud environments, the security guarantees provided by cloud service providers have become a critical factor in platform selection. Hardware-based security solutions offer stronger protection than software-based approaches alone, as they can establish a hardware root of trust that serves as a foundation for the entire security architecture.

The three dominant cloud service providers—AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—have each developed proprietary hardware security solutions to address these concerns. This paper surveys these solutions, examining their architectural approaches, technical implementations, and security guarantees.

We focus on four key aspects of hardware security:
1. Hardware root of trust implementations
2. Secure key management solutions
3. Confidential computing offerings
4. Hardware-backed identity management

By analyzing these aspects across the three major cloud providers, we aim to provide a comprehensive comparison that highlights the strengths and limitations of each approach.

## 2. Hardware Root of Trust

A hardware root of trust serves as the foundation for secure boot processes and establishes a chain of trust that extends from hardware to firmware, operating systems, and applications. Each cloud provider has developed a unique approach to implementing hardware root of trust.

### 2.1 AWS Nitro System

AWS has developed the Nitro System, a custom hardware and software solution that provides the foundation for their cloud infrastructure security. The Nitro System includes several key components:

**Nitro Security Chip:** A custom-designed hardware component that acts as the root of trust for each AWS server. It provides:
- Immutable boot process validation
- Continuous runtime firmware verification
- Hardware-based attestation
- Cryptographic acceleration

The Nitro Security Chip is implemented as a discrete component physically isolated from the main system, making it highly resistant to tampering or compromise. It validates all firmware before execution and prevents unauthorized modifications to the system.

**Nitro Cards:** Specialized hardware components that offload virtualization functions from the main CPU:
- Nitro I/O Card: Manages network and storage I/O
- Nitro Security Card: Provides additional security functions
- Nitro Controller Card: Manages the overall system

This architecture allows AWS to reduce the attack surface by moving virtualization functions to dedicated hardware, thereby minimizing the Trusted Computing Base (TCB).

### 2.2 Google Cloud Titan

Google Cloud's approach centers around their Titan security chip, which serves as the hardware root of trust for all Google Cloud infrastructure:

**Titan Security Chip:** A custom-designed, silicone-level security chip with:
- Secure boot capabilities
- Cryptographic identity
- Hardware-based key storage
- On-chip firmware validation

The Titan chip is designed to establish a verified boot process from the hardware level up through the software stack. It authenticates the earliest boot-time code and establishes a chain of trust that extends through the entire boot sequence.

**Titan in Infrastructure:** Google deploys Titan chips across their infrastructure:
- In servers and peripherals throughout their data centers
- In custom machine learning accelerators (TPUs)
- In consumer devices (Pixel phones, Chromebooks)

This provides a consistent security model across Google's ecosystem, from cloud infrastructure to edge devices.

### 2.3 Microsoft Azure Hardware Security

Microsoft Azure employs a multi-layered approach to hardware security, utilizing several technologies:

**Project Cerberus:** An open-source hardware security project contributed to the Open Compute Project (OCP) that provides:

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Architectural Philosophies

The three major cloud providers have adopted different architectural philosophies for their hardware security solutions:

**AWS:** Focuses on a unified, custom-designed hardware platform (Nitro) that provides comprehensive security guarantees across their infrastructure. This approach gives AWS complete control over their security architecture but limits transparency and external validation.

**Google Cloud:** Emphasizes a consistent security model based on the Titan chip, extending from cloud infrastructure to edge devices. This approach provides a coherent security story across Google's ecosystem but, like AWS, limits transparency.

**Microsoft Azure:** Adopts a multi-layered approach that leverages both proprietary technologies (Pluton) and open standards (Project Cerberus). This approach offers more flexibility and transparency but may result in a more complex security architecture.
